# gesture_experiments

This is a small experiment repository. I am looking at consuming, and storing gesture history on a tablet, using flutter.

Looking to work with this information, to use tablet(s) as a form of programmable input mechanisms (think keyboard replacements), work on modes of interaction with applications.

Think interacting with 3d visualizations & game systems. Moving, panning, rotating in intuitive ways.
